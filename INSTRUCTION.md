# Pair programming exercise: React chat

> A foreword to Windows users: please make sure you are using an LTS version of Node (the latest LTS release is 8.9.4). Verify that you are using the correct version with `node --version`.

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to create a simple chat application using React and WebSockets. Using components, you will implement functionality to enter a room, send messages, receive messages, and change rooms.

## Part 0: A WebSockets Reference

**Important:** Don't skip over this section! It is important in understanding how you will actually use sockets in this application

> **Note:** Give this a quick overview and **refer back** to this section later to determine what events to emit and when!

Below is a reference to all WebSockets events that you will be listening for and emitting for the purpose of chat. A WebSockets chat server has already been set up for you on the same server that is serving up your React application.

<sub>**Send** indicates a WebSockets event that goes from Client (your browser, running a React application) to Server (your Node application, running a WebSockets server). **Receive** denotes a WebSockets event that goes from Server to Client.</sub>

* **Send:** `username` - This must be the first event emitted after a successful socket connection; no other events will work unless a username has been emitted and stored.
	* _Emit_ with a String that represents your username
	* _Will emit_ `errorMessage` with "No username!" if the username is invalid. Duplicate usernames are permissible.
* **Send:** `room` - This event will be used for both connecting to a room initially and changing between rooms.
	* _Emit_ with a String that represents the room you want to join
	* _Will emit_ `errorMessage` with "No room!" if you do not pass in anything to the `room` event
	* _Will emit_ `errorMessage` with "Username not set!" if no username has been set yet.
* **Send:** `message` - This event will be used for sending messages to the server to be sent to the rest of the room.
	* _Emit_ with a String that represents the contents of the message you want to send.
	* **Note:** You must handle displaying your own messages that you send - your own messages _will not_ be broadcast back to you.
* **Receive:** `message` - This event will be used for all messages sent - you will only receive this event for messages sent in the current room you are in (set by sending a `room` event).
	* _Will emit_ an **Object** (important!) that has a property `username` indicating who the message is coming from and property `content` containing the message's text contents
		* **Example:**

			```javascript
			{
			  "username": "Ethan",
			  "content": "Did you commit today?"
			}
			```
		* **Note:** All user join events will automatically broadcast a message coming from "System" that looks like "_a user_ has joined". You can test if your `message` receiving handlers are working by having multiple "users" join a room on different tabs of your browser.
* **Receive:** `errorMessage` - This event will be sent from the server for any errors. Listen for this event on the client to handle errors such as "Username not set!"
	* _Will emit_ back with any error messages for the client, could be any one of the following (their meanings speak for themselves):
		* "No username!"
		* "No room!"
		* "Username not set!"
		* "No rooms joined!"
	* _Tip:_ If you want to continually ask your user for a username until they enter a valid (non-empty) username, check if the `errorMessage` data you get back is equal to "No username!" and prompt them again if so. Don't forget to emit the `username` event back to the socket!


Remember: all WebSockets events are received like the following:

```javascript
this.socket.on('eventName', function(dataFromEvent) {
	// Do something with dataFromEvent
})
```

and all WebSockets events are sent like the following:

```javascript
this.socket.emit('eventName', 'dataToSend');
```

Note that we already handled connections for you and stored the socket object on `this.state` - the root state of the `<App />` component.

## Part 1: Chat component - `client/app.js`

> **Note:** After completing (and while completing) Step 1, you should be testing your application. Use multiple browser tabs to attempt to send and receive messages between your tabs!

For Part 1, you will be working with one chat room, sending and receiving messages from a group of users that are connected to a single room. The end result of **Part 1** should look something like the following:

<img src="img/chat1.png" width="600">

Start by implementing some basics that we have given you function definitions for (replace `YOUR CODE HERE`):

1. Create a new property on `this.state` in the constructor called `roomName` with a default name of a room - because they have not yet selected a room, "No room selected!" is fine.
1. Get and store a username from the user in the callback of the socket's `connect` event - you may use `prompt()` to get input from the user in an easy way! Store your username in the state object at `this.state` using `setState`.
1. Determine how you will handle errors by filling in the callback function of the socket's `errorMessage` event. `alert()`ing potential errors is sufficient here.

Next, we'll write our logic for sending and receiving messages in a `<ChatRoom />` React component. Notice in **`client/app.js`** that there is already a button setup with an `onClick` event of the `join` function, passing in "Party Place."

> **Note:** Since we're only dealing with one room at a time for now, calling `join` with only "Party Place" for now is fine - when we design a `<ChatRoomSelector />` component in the next step, we will need to change things.

Change the `join` function so that when it is called, it does not simply log the passed-in room name (`room`), but also calls `setState` to change the room name as a part of the `state` of the top-level `<App />` component - you named this in the first step in the constructor as `roomName`. Remember that we always modify state with the `setState` function! After setting your state, emit a `room` event with the room name that you just received to enter the "Party Place" room.

Next, create a component called `<ChatRoom />` that handles all the logic for sending and receiving messages in its [component lifecycle](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html) methods. We will pass three props into `ChatRoom` when we render it:

* `socket` - pass `this.state.socket` (from `<App />`) down to its child `<ChatRoom />` so that it can communicate on the same WebSockets connection
* `roomName` - pass `this.state.roomName` (or whatever name you've set for storing the room name in the state from the previous step, from `<App />`) down to its child `<ChatRoom />` so that the component knows what room name to join and display when it is rendered into the `<App />`.
* `username` - pass `this.state.username` (or whatever name you've set for storing the username in the state from the previous step, from `<App />`) down to its child `<ChatRoom />` so that the component knows what username to display when a new message comes in.

Now, use the lifecycle methods you learned to change state and the display of the `<ChatRoom />` over time. You may try to design these yourself, or you can follow the spec below:

### Lifecycle spec for `<ChatRoom />` component - `client/app.js`
* `constructor` (called before a component gets rendered to set its state object)
  * Calls `super(props)`
  * Sets the state of the component with the following:
		* A property (suggestion: `message`) representing a message that the user is typing - we will use this later, but for now, set it to empty string!
		* A property (suggestion: `messages`) representing all messages sent and received in the room - we will also use this later, but for now, it could be an empty array!
* `componentDidMount` (called right before a component "mounts" or gets rendered)
	* On `componentDidMount`, set your event handlers for displaying messages using `this.props.socket` - the socket object that you passed in as a property to the `<ChatRoom />` component. Refer to **Step 0: A WebSockets Reference** for a refresher on setting WebSockets event handlers. Your event handlers should call `this.setState` and update an array of message objects that you are storing. 
		* **TIP**: Assign the messages array to a new variable, push the following into that array, and finally, set the messages property in the state using `setState()`. (Refer to the warning at the bottom)
	
			```
			`${message.username}: ${message.content}`
			```
	* _Tip:_ Try `alert()`ing your messages before you create the rest of your `<ChatRoom />` component to test that your socket event handler is working properly. You can send a message by emitting!
* `componentWillReceiveProps` (called when receiving new props - i.e., a change of the `roomName` prop passed in from `<App />`)
	* On `componentWillReceiveProps`, you want to check if there has been a change to `this.props.roomName` - this means that we will have switched rooms (in this part, `componentWillReceiveProps` will have little functional effect since we only have one room, but it will be used in the next step).
	* Remember that `componentWillReceiveProps` takes a parameter (`nextProps`) that represents the new props that have been passed into `<ChatRoom />`. Compare `nextProps.roomName` (the new name prop) to `this.props.roomName` (the old name prop) and if they are different, do the following:
		* Call `setState` with an object that sets your `messages` array to empty again.

	<sub>**Read more about `componentWillReceiveProps` with examples and documentation [here](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html#updating-componentwillreceiveprops)**.</sub>
* `render` (called to display the component)
	* On `render`, you will be handling the display of both messages and a text input to send messages through. Below are the basics that you want to handle:
		* An array of message elements on the page that are created through the array of message objects that you stored earlier - you may choose to display these as list items, table rows, or paragraphs.
		* A form element that contains the following:
			* A text input element with an `onChange` property that **takes a function that you create** to update the property of `state` that you set as an empty string in `constructor()` (representing a message that the user is typing). This text input element should also have a `value` property of that same `state` property.
			* A submit input element or button that says "Send" to submit the form it is in
	* The form element should also be given an `onSubmit` property that **takes a function that you create** to clear the property of state we used for the message that the user is typing (setting it to empty string) and **emit** a `message` event as specified in **Step 0: A WebSockets Reference**. This **function that you create** should do the following:
		* Take an event object (`e`, `evt`, whatever you want to call it) as a parameter
		* Call `preventDefault` on the event object you take as a parameter
		* Update the messages array in your state with the message you just sent, since we will not receive `message` events for messages that we sent.
		* _Tip:_ You can get the username of the current user through `this.props.username`!
		
> ⚠️ **Warning:** Do not use `this.state.messages.push` (or the equivalent for the array that is storing your messages) to put new messages in your state. Remember, we always call `setState` to modify state rather than changing `this.state` itself. Instead of pushing directly, you could push to a temporary array and then set the temporary array to the new `messages` inside of `setState` or use [`.concat(/* an item you want to put in */)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat) to return you an array with a new item at the end.

## Part 2: Multi-room chat - `client/app.js`

Next, we'll implement multiple rooms with a separate component (on the same level as `<ChatRoom />`) called `<ChatRoomSelector />` that will allow us to change which room we are currently chatting with. Note that you will be hard-coding values for room names. The end result will look like the following:

<img src="img/chat2.png" width="600">

### Restructuring `<App />` a little - `client/app.js`

Because we are dealing with multiple rooms now, we will have to replace our button that calls `this.join` with the name of the only room we have ("Party Place") with a component that we will design below.

Before doing so, however, change the property of `roomName` in the `constructor` of the top-level `<App />` component to the name of the **default room to join** (the name of the first tab) instead of "No room selected!"

Next, add another property to the state of the component in `constructor` called `rooms` that is an array of all room names that you want to display, i.e. `["Party Place", "Josh's Fun Time", "Sandwich Connoisseurs", "CdT"]`.

Last thing: move the emitting of the `room` event from the `join` function into the callback function of the `connect` event, and emit this event with `this.state.roomName` instead. This will cause your application to connect to the default room as soon as it connects. **Make sure you are `prompt()`ing for and emitting a `username` before you emit a `room` event.**

That's all the restructuring we need! We handled potential changes to `this.props.roomName` on the `<ChatRoom />` level in the last step, so now, changes to `this.state.roomName` on the `<App />` level should emit a new `room` event and update state accordingly.

### Spec for `<ChatRoomSelector />` component - `client/app.js`
Now, it's up to you to design this component from the ground-up using the below spec of props and lifecycle methods.

**Props**

Note that all of these props are passed in from the `<App />` level, when we render a `<ChatRoomSelector />` element in the `render` function of the `App` class.

* `rooms` - pass in `this.state.rooms`: all of the rooms that we want this selector to display
* `roomName` - pass in `this.state.roomName`: the room that we currently have selected (defaults to the first!)
* `onSwitch` - pass in `this.join`: we will set up `<ChatRoomSelector />` such that `this.join` (referred to as `this.props.onSwitch` inside our `<ChatRoomSelector />` class) is called with the name of the room we want to join.

**Methods**

* `render` (**React Lifecycle method**) - this method will render the tab component as follows:
	* We will use list item elements (`<li>`) to represent each tab representing a room. Refer to [Bootstrap documentation on the `nav-tabs` class](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#nav-tabs) for tips on styling these tabs nicely.
	* Loop over (or map) `this.props.rooms` and create an array of `<li>` elements for each one, sticking them inside of a `<ul>` at the end. For Bootstrap `nav-tabs`, add a `className="active"` if the current room you are at when looping through or mapping is equal to `this.props.roomName ` (the current room).
	* For each of your list item elements, add an `onClick` property that will look something like: `onClick={() => { this.props.onSwitch(/* the room name */) }}`

## Challenge: "User is typing" 🏆

Create new events in `server.js` called `typing` and `stop typing` that handles received `typing` and `stop typing` events and emits the same events to the rest of the room.

You will also need to change your `client/app.js` to emit a `typing` event when the user is typing (or when `this.state.message` is not empty!) and a `stop typing` event when they are not! Handle the display logic accordingly by updating the `state` of your `<ChatRoom />` to include an array of typing users and rendering with `<span>` items of each typing user with "_username_ is typing..."

The end result will look like the following:

Good luck!
